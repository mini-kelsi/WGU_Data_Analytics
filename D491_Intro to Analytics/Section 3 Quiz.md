19. What is the most appropriate data analytics technique for analyzing website traffic patterns?
    - Heat map
      > A heat map is a graphical representation of data that uses color coding to visualize the magnitude or frequency of a variable across two dimensions.  Heat maps display large amounts of data in a way that is easy to interpret and identify patterns.

20. What is the advantage of using a decision tree over a linear regression model in a data analytics project?
    - **Decision trees can handle nonlinear relationships between variables.**
      > *Decision trees can model complex, nonlinear relationships between variables, while linear regression models are limited to liinear relationships.*
