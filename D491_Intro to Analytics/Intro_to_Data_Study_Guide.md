    > "Why did an event happen?" "What caused it to happen?"
  - **Predictive Analytics**
    > Forecast future outcomes.
    > "Why did an even happen?" "Why caused it to happen?"
  - **Prescriptive Analytics**
    > Recommends actions that can be taken to optimize or improve a situation.
    > "What should we do?" "How can we prepare for it?"

- Identify & describe the model planning phase
  > This is the phase where the most suitable models are chosen based on the business goals and the types of relationships that need to be discovered in the data.
  > Focuses on identifying candidate models for clustering, classifying or finding relationships and ensuring analytical techniques align with business objectives.
  
- Explain the purpose of the modeling planning phase
