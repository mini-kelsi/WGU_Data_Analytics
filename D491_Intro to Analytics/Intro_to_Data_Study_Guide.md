## Section 1 - Careers and Goals  

- Define Data Analytics

- Define Data Science
  - The practice of using statistical methods to extract insights from data
   
- Differentiate between data analytics and data science
  - **Data science focuses on _developing new algorithms and models_, while data analytics focuses on using _existing models_ to analyze data.**

- Identify data analytics projects
  - **Descriptive Analytics**
    > Focuses on *summarizing and describing* historical data to provide insights to past trends and patterns.
    > "What happened?" "How many times did it happen?"
  - **Diagnostic Analytics**
    > Identify the *root causes* of specific outcomes or events.
    > "Why did an event happen?" "What caused it to happen?"
  - **Predictive Analytics**
    > Forecast future outcomes.
    > "Why did an even happen?" "Why caused it to happen?"
  - **Prescriptive Analytics**
    > Recommends actions that can be taken to optimize or improve a situation.
    > "What should we do?" "How can we prepare for it?"
  - **Exploratory Analytics**
    > Involves exploring and analyzing data to identify potential trends, patterns ,and relationships.
    > Often used when their is *no clear objective or question to answer.*

   - Project team members and senior management
     
- Iteract with stakeholders
- Define the roles of the stakeholders in the data analytics projects
  - Project Sponsor
     > Executive who has authorized the project and is responsible for ensuring the project aligns with the company's strategic goals.
   - Project Manager
     > Oversees the project's day-to-day operations, including coordinating with stakeholders and ensuring that the project stays on track.
   - Financial Operations
     > Responsible for managing the budget and finances of the project.

     > Responsible for interpreting the results of specific data.
   - Partners
     >External stakeholders collaborating with the company on the project.
   - End Users (Customers)
     >Ultimate beneficiaries of the project, as they will benefit from a more effient and optimized inventory management system.

  ## Section 2 - The Data Analytics Lifecycle

- Identify & describe the **discovery phase**
  > First phase of the Data Analytics Life Cycle.
  
- Explain the purpose fo the discovery phase
  > The data team familarizes themselves with the business domain, examines relevant historical data, and assesses available resources such as people, technology, time, and data.
  > Framing the business problem ass an analytics challenge and formulating initial hypotheses to test and explore data.
  
- Define the question of interest of the data analytics project
  > What is the team attempting to achieve by doing the project, and what will be considered "good enough" as an outcome of the project?
  
- Assess the resources or resource contraints of the data analytics project
  > Ensure the project team has the right mix of domain experts, customers, analytic talent, and project management to be effective. Also evaluate how much time is needed and if the team has the right breadth and depth of skills.
  
- Define outcomes of the data analytics project
  > Gathering enough data to draft an analytics plan and share it for peer review.  Also developing a success criteria to clarify the problem definition and help the team when it comes time to make choices about the analytical methods being used later in the project.
  
- Identify & describe the **data preparation phase**
  > Can work with the data and perform analytics throughout the project.  The team needs to create a robust environment in which it can explore the data that is separate from a production environment.
  
- Explain the purpose of the data preparation phase
  > ETL processes are executed to prepare the data for analysis, and the team becomes thoroughly acquainted with the data.  Understanding the data in detail is critiacal to the success of the project. 
  
- Identify sources of data
  >
  
- Identify the common tools for data preparation
   - Hadoop
     > Can perform massively parallel ingest and custom analysis for web traffic parsing, GPS location analytics, genomic anlaysis, and combining of massive unstructured data feeds from multiple sourses.
   - Alpine Miner
     > Provides a graphical users interface (GUI) for creating analytics workflows, including data manipulations and a series of analytic events such as staged data-mining tecniques on Postgres SQL and other Big Data sources.
   - OpenRefine
     >"a free, open source, powerful took for working with messy data." Popular GUI-based tool for performing data transformations, and it's one of the most robust free tools currently available.
   - Data Wrangler
     > interative tool for data cleaning and transformation. outputs can be put into Java or Python.
  
- Identify steps for the data preparation phase
  > Preparing Analytic Sandbox, Preforming ETLT, Data Conditioning, Survey and Visualize
  
- Identify & describe the model planning phase
  > Team determins the methods, techniques, workflows to be used during the subsequent model building phase.
  
- Explain the purpose of the modeling planning phase
  > The team explores data relationships, selects key variables, and identifies the most suitable modesl fro the project.
  
- Identify the activities of the data modeling phase
  
- Identify common tools for the model planning phase
  
- Identify common models used in the model planning phase
  
- Identify & describe the model execution phase
  > 
  
- Explain the purpose of the model execution phase
  > To develope datasets for testing, training and production purposes, builds and executes models based on the planning phase, and evaluates the need for more robust tools or enviroments for executing models and workflows.
  
- Identify the activites of the model execution phase
- Identify the common tools for the model execution phase
- Identify & describe the communicate results phase
  >
  
- Explain the purpose of the communicate results phase
  >Determining the project's success or failure based on the criteria developed in the discovery phase. The team identifies key findings, quantifies the business value, and develops a narrative to summarize and communicate the results to stakeholders.

- Identify the activities of the communicate results phase
- Identify the common tools for communicating results
- Identify & describe the operationalize phases
  > Last phase of the Data Analytics Life Cycle.
  
- Explain the purpose of the operationalize phase
  > Team delievers reports, briefings, code, and technical documents. A pilot project may be implemented to test the models in a production environment, ensuring that the results are framed effectively and demonstrate clear value to stakeholders.
