## Section 1 - Careers and Goals  

- Define Data Analytics
  - The process of analyzing data to extract insights
   
- Define Data Science
  - The practice of using statistical methods to extract insights from data
   
- Differentiate between data analytics and data science
  - **Data science focuses on _developing new algorithms and models_, while data analytics focuses on using _existing models_ to analyze data.**

- Identify data analytics projects
  - **Descriptive Analytics**
    > Focuses on *summarizing and describing* historical data to provide insights to past trends and patterns.
    > "What happened?" "How many times did it happen?"
  - **Diagnostic Analytics**
    > Identify the *root causes* of specific outcomes or events.
    > "Why did an event happen?" "What caused it to happen?"
  - **Predictive Analytics**
    > Forecast future outcomes.
    > "Why did an even happen?" "Why caused it to happen?"
  - **Prescriptive Analytics**
    > Recommends actions that can be taken to optimize or improve a situation.
    > "What should we do?" "How can we prepare for it?"
  - **Exploratory Analytics**
    > Involves exploring and analyzing data to identify potential trends, patterns ,and relationships.
    > Often used when their is *no clear objective or question to answer.*
   
- Identify the fuctions of a specific career
