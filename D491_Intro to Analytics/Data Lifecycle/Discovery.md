### Discovery Phase

* In this phase, the data science team must learn and investigate the problem, develop context and understanding, and learn about the data sources needed and available for the project.
* The team formulates initial hypotheses that can later be tested with data.
* **Understanding the domain area of the problem is essential.**
* The team needs to determine *how much* business or domain knowledge the data scientist needs to develop models in Phases 3 and 4.
* The team needs to assess the *resources available* to support the project.
* Consider the **long term goals.**
* **Framing the probelm well is _critical to the success_ of the project.**
  >Best practice is to write down the problem statement and share it with the key stakeholders.
* **Important** to identify the main objectives of the project, identify what needs to be achieved in business terms, and identify what needds to be done to meet the needs.
  > Consider the objectives and the success criteria for the project.
* Identify **key stakeholders** and their interest in the project
* **Developing a set of initial hypotheses is a key facet of the discovery phase**
  > involves forming ideas that the tea, can test with data
  > best to come up with a few primary hypotheses to test and then be creative about developing several more
* **Identify the kinds of data the team will need to solve the problem**
* Consider the volume, type, and time span of the data needed to test the hypotheses.
* Team will need *raw data* to avoid introducin *bias*
   - Identify data sources
   - Capture aggregate data sources
   - Review the raw data
   - Evaluate the data structures and tools needed
   - Scope the sort of data infrastructure needed for this type of problem
